# AI Fashion Photoshoot Studio

This is a React-based web application that uses the Google Gemini API to generate new editorial-style fashion images. You can upload a photo of a model, describe a new scene, and the AI will generate a new image maintaining the model's appearance and clothing in the described setting.

## Features

-   **Image Upload**: Upload a source image of a model.
-   **AI Image Generation**: Describe a new scene with a text prompt to generate a new image.
-   **Image Enhancement**: Upscale and improve the photorealism of the generated image.
-   **Advanced Export**: Download the final image with custom settings for format, quality, resolution, and color grading.
